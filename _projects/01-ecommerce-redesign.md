## Overview

This project involved a comprehensive redesign of an existing e-commerce platform that was struggling with high cart abandonment rates and poor mobile conversion. Our goal was to create a seamless, mobile-first shopping experience that would increase conversions and improve user satisfaction.

## Challenge

The original platform had several critical issues:
- **High cart abandonment rate** (78% on mobile)
- **Cluttered product pages** with poor information hierarchy
- **Complicated checkout process** requiring 7+ steps
- **Inconsistent design language** across different sections

## Solution

### Research & Discovery
- Conducted user interviews with 25 customers
- Analyzed heat maps and user session recordings
- Performed competitive analysis of 10 leading e-commerce sites
- Created user personas and journey maps

### Design Process
1. **Information Architecture**: Restructured the site navigation and product categorization
2. **Mobile-First Approach**: Designed for mobile screens first, then scaled up
3. **Streamlined Checkout**: Reduced checkout to 3 steps with guest checkout option
4. **Visual Redesign**: Created a clean, modern design system with consistent components

## Key Features

- **One-tap checkout** for returning customers
- **Live inventory updates** to reduce order cancellations
- **Smart product recommendations** based on browsing history
- **Enhanced search** with filters and auto-suggestions
- **Wishlist and comparison** tools

## Results

After launching the redesign, the client saw significant improvements:
- **45% reduction** in cart abandonment rate
- **60% increase** in mobile conversions
- **35% improvement** in average session duration
- **Net Promoter Score** increased from 32 to 67

## Technologies Used

- Figma for design and prototyping
- Maze for user testing
- Hotjar for analytics and heatmaps
- Design system built with atomic design principles
