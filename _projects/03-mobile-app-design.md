## Overview

FitStreak is a fitness tracking app designed to help users build sustainable exercise habits through positive reinforcement and social accountability. Unlike traditional fitness apps that focus purely on metrics, FitStreak emphasizes habit formation and community support.

## Challenge

The fitness app market is saturated with apps that:
- **Overwhelm users** with complex features and data
- **Focus on intensity** rather than consistency
- **Lack personalization** for different fitness levels
- **Have poor long-term retention** (avg. 30-day retention: 12%)

## Research & Insights

### User Research
Conducted research with 40 participants across different fitness levels:
- 15 in-depth interviews
- 2-week diary studies with 25 users
- Survey of 200+ potential users
- Analysis of 8 competitor apps

### Key Findings
1. **Motivation over metrics**: Users want encouragement more than data
2. **Fear of judgment**: Many avoid social features due to comparison anxiety
3. **Habit is key**: Consistency matters more than intensity for beginners
4. **Simplicity wins**: Users abandon apps that feel too complicated

## Design Principles

1. **Progress over perfection**: Celebrate showing up, not just results
2. **Inclusive by default**: Welcome all fitness levels and abilities
3. **Privacy-first social**: Share only what you're comfortable with
4. **Joyful interactions**: Make the app feel encouraging, not demanding
